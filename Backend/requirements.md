Next steps:

- define TS schema
- fix type errors within app.ts
- add in error handlings
- get data

### Data Gathering

I need:

- schedule (date and time)
- weather (bad weather = extra time)
- each day, need to check game status (every hour for canceled, rescheduled)

### P1

Outcomes of P1:

- Pull in data from API and display in a table view
- Unit tests

#### Data Structure

Event

- Event name
- Start time
- End Time
- Date
- Location (longitude, latitude)

User

- Desired Arrival Time
-

- Pull in data

- Parse the data

- Render a view and display data in table format:

Data:

- MLB
- NHL
- UW
- SU
